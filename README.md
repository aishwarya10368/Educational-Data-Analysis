# Educational-Data-Analysis
This repository features an analysis of an educational dataset that examines factors such as gender distribution, parental education, and marital status on student performance. It includes visualizations like gender distribution and heatmaps showing average scores in Math, Reading, and Writing based on parental education and marital status. Additionally, boxplots illustrate score distributions, and a pie chart displays ethnic group representation. The analysis also addresses missing values by identifying them and employing strategies like row removal and mean imputation.
